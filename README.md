## What is Jira?

- Jira is a well-known project management solution that helps users map out, prioritize, and delegate their tasks. Typically used by software teams that build and ship products, the system streamlines the app development process from conceptualization to execution.
- Jira Software allows teams to flexibly plan in ways that they find most convenient thanks to its support for Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban methodologies. Furthermore, your teams have access to critical and actionable insight regarding their agile process through the systemâ€™s visual, data-driven reporting.
